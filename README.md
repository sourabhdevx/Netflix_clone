## ⚡ React + Vite Starter Template

This project is a **minimal yet powerful React + Vite boilerplate**, built and customized by me to kickstart fast and scalable front-end development. It integrates **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for a seamless dev experience and comes with basic ESLint rules for cleaner, more maintainable code.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React** – Frontend UI library
- **Vite** – Superfast build tool and dev server
- **ESLint** – Enforced code quality
- **Babel / SWC** – Supports Fast Refresh with:
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react` (Babel-based)
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` (SWC-based)

### 🚀 Features
- Lightning-fast startup with Vite
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for real-time development
- Clean and scalable folder structure
- Pre-configured ESLint rules for code quality
- Easy to extend with Tailwind, React Router, Redux, etc.
